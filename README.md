Historical experimentation mod for Victoria 2.

A mod that seeks to make minor changes to the early game economy through tech changes and pop need changes. Early industrialization has 
been made easier for certain countries with large amounts of aristocrat and capitalist pops (the UK and Prussia are the best two examples)
and rgo outputs have been made better to avoid the major resource shortages that can occur during the 20th century.

Specificity on mod changes:

- Capitalist and aristocrat needs increased
- RGO and factory throughput doubled for railroads
- Amount of currency produced per unit of precious metals doubled
- Early industrial technology changed to increase RGO output
- Laissez-faire economic policy changed slightly
- Guards and dreadnought stat increases, and corresponding supply increases to make the more expensive
- Infantry made generally more expensive
- Minimum wage social reforms increased to direct more money toward workers

The intended effect was for the world economy to run smoother and with a greater amount of money being in the hands of pops/factories to promote economic output, rather than running into the "liquidity crisis" that can affect the game. From one play test these changes seem to have had the intended effect
