# HEM
Historical experimentation mod for Victoria 2.

A mod that seeks to make minor changes to the early game economy through tech changes and pop need changes. Early industrialization has 
been made easier for certain countries with large amounts of aristocrat and capitalist pops (the UK and Prussia are the best two examples)
and rgo outputs have been made better to avoid the major resource shortages that can occur during the 20th century.

A specific change log will be added when event chains are made a feature.
